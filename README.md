# Hey, I'm Dmitriy

I build AI tools that are meant to be practical and run on normal hardware.

Most of my recent work focuses on making AI more accessible - whether that's language models that don't require a datacenter, RAG systems you can run locally or tools to check if your ML models might be biased.

## Current projects

**[PolyglotLite](https://github.com/IIIDman/polyglotlite)** - Lightweight multilingual language models (100-500M params) for consumer hardware. Supports 50+ languages.

**[RAGKit](https://github.com/IIIDman/ragkit)** - Simple framework for building document Q&A apps. Local-first, no API keys required for basic setup.

**[FairLens](https://github.com/IIIDman/fairlens)** - Bias detection toolkit for ML models. Quick audits without the complexity of larger frameworks.

## What I'm interested in

- Efficient ML - getting good results without massive compute
- Multilingual NLP - there's a lot of underserved languages out there
- Responsible AI - bias detection, fairness metrics, that sort of thing
- Making AI tools that regular developers can actually use
